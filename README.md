Task2: Early Detection of Signs of Self-Harm

## Goal

The goal of this particular task is to detect early risk of self-harm.  

We use techniques of text mining to help identify people with self-harm tendency. We hope to explore several common text mining techniques, learn how to apply them with Python in real world context, understand their model parameters by experimenting and tuning them, and compare and contrast the performance and accuracy of different text mining models to better understand their best use cases.

## Use Case

- download jupyter notebook
- download dataset in the same folder, in train and test. For privacy reason dataset will not be shown publicly, so we only include empty data folders and empty data files here. To get relevant data, please join the eRisk competition and ask data from the host of the contest. 
- Run the command in jupyter notebook one by one. Note some of the train task may take very long, more than 10 minutes.
  - Our approach is to run each model in a different notebook to parallize training and evaluation. And the notebook are named by their model trained. It's best you do the same.
